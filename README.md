CONCLUSIONS:

1) Based on the first scatter plot detailing City Latitude vs. Max Temperature; It is clear that the Max temperatures are all between the Latitude ranges of 30 to 40 Degrees; This was interesting to see as I originally thought that the max would fall on or near the equator itself but it is actually 2-3 measurments on the spectrum away!

2) Based on my second scatter plot representing Latitude vs. Humidity, it is clear a high humidity level does not have a strong correlation with where a city falls on the latitude spectrum as there are cities spread throughout the entire range at 100 % humidity.  However in the other findings, it is clear that the places that are the least humid primarily fall again, in the 20-40 degree range which is similarly correlated with the above plot (Lat. vs. Max Temp)

3) Not a strong finding/correlation between latitude vs. Cloudiness and latitude vs. Wind Speed; Both scatter plots show pretty uniform distribution and no lattitude level stands apart from the other in these 2 comparisons.
